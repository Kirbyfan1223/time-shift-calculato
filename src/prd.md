# Time Difference Calculator - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Calculate time differences in minutes for schedule adjustments within the same working day, handling both forward and backward time changes.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can quickly input start time, original arrival, and new arrival to get precise minute differences for scheduling decisions.
- **Experience Qualities**: Precise, Intuitive, Efficient

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Micro Tool (single-purpose utility)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (quick calculations for scheduling)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Users need to calculate time differences when adjusting schedules within the same day, without next-day assumptions.
- **User Context**: Quick calculations during schedule planning or adjustment scenarios.
- **Critical Path**: Input three times → Calculate → Get precise minute difference.
- **Key Moments**: Time input interactions and result display with clear earlier/later indication.

## Essential Features

### Time Input System
- **Functionality**: 12-hour format time inputs with hour, minute, and AM/PM selection
- **Purpose**: Intuitive time entry that matches common time formats
- **Success Criteria**: All times parse correctly and persist between sessions

### Same-Day Calculation Logic
- **Functionality**: Calculate time differences without assuming next-day scenarios
- **Purpose**: Handle cases like 2:00 PM start, 2:30 PM original arrival, 12:00 PM new arrival within same work period
- **Success Criteria**: Returns accurate minute differences for both forward and backward time changes

### Result Display
- **Functionality**: Show minute difference with clear earlier/later indication
- **Purpose**: Immediate understanding of schedule impact
- **Success Criteria**: Results are clearly formatted with color-coded feedback

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence and clarity
- **Design Personality**: Clean, precise, business-focused
- **Visual Metaphors**: Calculator and clock iconography
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface focusing on essential inputs and clear results

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.4 0.15 240)) - represents trust and precision
- **Secondary Colors**: Light blue-grays for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - draws attention to calculations and results
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys reliability for time calculations, orange creates urgency for time-sensitive decisions
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast ratios maintained throughout
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (white) with Foreground (dark blue) - 13.2:1 ratio
  - Primary (deep blue) with Primary-foreground (white) - 10.8:1 ratio
  - Accent (orange) with Accent-foreground (white) - 7.1:1 ratio

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family for consistency
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headings, medium weight for labels, regular for body text
- **Font Personality**: Clean, modern, highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Tabular numbers for precise time display
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and spacing throughout
- **Which fonts**: Inter - excellent for UI with superior number legibility
- **Legibility Check**: Inter's tabular figures ensure perfect alignment of time values

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Vertical flow from inputs to calculation button to results
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Center-aligned single column layout with consistent card spacing
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with max-width constraints
- **Content Density**: Focused on essential elements only

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions reinforce the professional, precise nature
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Focus on result display animations
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal motion to maintain business tool feel

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for input grouping, Buttons for actions, Alerts for results
- **Component Customization**: Accent color for primary actions, muted tones for secondary elements
- **Component States**: Clear hover and focus states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Calculator and Clock icons from Phosphor for consistency
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary calculation button, secondary time inputs
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4-unit spacing system via Tailwind
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly input sizes and button targets

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with shadcn foundation
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color usage, spacing, typography, interaction patterns
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card heights and spacing creates predictable layout
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional tool aesthetic matching business context

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved for all text and meaningful elements
- Form labels properly associated with inputs
- Keyboard navigation support through native form elements
- Clear error messaging for invalid inputs

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Invalid Time Formats**: Clear error messages for unparseable time inputs
- **Missing Inputs**: Disabled calculation until all fields complete
- **Same Time Scenarios**: Handle zero-difference calculations gracefully
- **Extreme Time Differences**: Support calculations across full 12-hour periods

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Single-purpose tool with potential for additional time utilities
- **Testing Focus**: Validate calculation accuracy across various time scenarios
- **Critical Questions**: Ensure same-day logic handles all user workflow scenarios

## Reflection
This approach prioritizes calculation accuracy and user clarity over complex features. The same-day calculation logic addresses the specific workflow needs while maintaining a simple, focused interface that builds user confidence in the results.
